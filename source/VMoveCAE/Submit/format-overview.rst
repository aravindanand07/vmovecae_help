         Line format

-  Sections and data lines need to specify the name.

-  Data lines for a some sections (STEP section) need the values to be
   specified along with the data name.

-  Both sections and data lines are made of attributes separated by
   ``,`` characters.

-  Attribute is of the form ``<attribute_name>=<attribute_value>``.

-  Attribute value is optional in many cases. If attribute value is not
   specified, the default value is used.

-  If user needs to specify a list of values for any key, the user needs
   to specify them in quotes and using ``,`` as separator.

-  All the keywords (name, value, attribute name and attribute value)
   are case insensitive, except for the file names.
