Viewer and CAX File Compatibility
=================================

VCollab viewers can load CAX files generated by VMoveCAE of the same version or earlier versions. 

For example, **VCollab Professional 2015R1** and **VCollab Presenter 2015R1** can read CAX files generated by **VMoveCAE 2015R1** and earlier versions. 

However, prior versions of VCollab Professional, VCollab Presenter will not support CAX files generated by VMoveCAE 2015R1. 

If a newer version of CAX file is detected by the VCollab viewers, an error message is displayed to the user. The error is also logged in the log file.
